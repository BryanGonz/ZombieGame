This is a project I did for CS32 Intro to CS II at UCLA.

For complete detailed documentation on this program please see the pdf files in this folder.

My tasks:
	1. To separate the one large file with many classes into their own class .cpp and 
		.h files with the correct directives such as, but not limited to, #include and 
		#ifndef.
	2. To implement the entire History class and make it a functioning part of the 
		program.

Code I generated for this project:
	- All directives and headers
	- The entire History .h and .cpp files
	- Game.cpp, lines 85-92
	- Arena.cpp, lines 176-180
