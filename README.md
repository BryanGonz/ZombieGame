This is a project I did for CS32: Introduction to CS II at UCLA.

For complete detailed documentation on this program please see the pdf files in this folder.

My tasks:

	1. To separate the single large file with many classes into separate files pertaining to each class. Files were divided into .cpp and .h files with the correct directives such as, but not limited to #include and #ifndef.

	2. To implement the entire History class and make it a functioning part of the program.

Code I generated for this project:

	- All directives and headers

	- The entire History .h and .cpp files

	- Game.cpp, lines 85-92

	- Arena.cpp, lines 176-180
