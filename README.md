This is a project I did for CS32: Introduction to CS II at UCLA.

For complete detailed documentation on this program please see the pdf files in this folder.

To play this game compile the .cpp and .h files in the code folder and run the main routine as is. 
You may also change the arguements in the "Game g(7, 8, 25);" constructor to change the arena size and number of zombies in the arena. 

My tasks:

	1. To separate the single large file with many classes into separate files pertaining to each class. 
	Files were divided into .cpp and .h files with the correct directives such as, but not limited to #include and #ifndef.

	2. To implement the entire History class and make it a functioning part of the program.

Code I generated for this project:

	- All directives and headers

	- The entire History .h and .cpp files

	- Game.cpp, lines 85-92

	- Arena.cpp, lines 176-180

You may also replicate this project by reading the P1spec.pdf and using my code as a solution.
